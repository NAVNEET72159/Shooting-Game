# Shooting-Game
Hello Everyone, 
I am Navneet Shandilya. I had done B. Tech. (CSE) from Dr. Shakuntala Misra National Rehabilitation University. I had made this game with python using PGZero, CV2 and Mediapipe.
This is a shooting game which you anyone can simulate through their gesture (Forefinger and Thumb).
